In a corner of space, far away from our own sun's warmth and light, lies an extraordinary family called Trappist-1. It is not made up of people but planets that revolve around their parent star just like how we orbit the Sun in our solar system. And today on planet F, one small child named Zeno woke to another day full of wonder under a sky completely unlike any seen back home on Earth.

F was part of Trappist-1's family called TRAPPIST-1f and it lived two times the distance from its parent star as our beloved planet Mercury does in comparison with the Sun, ensuring that F always basked under a comfortable warmth which allowed liquid water to flow freely on Zeno’selbow.

Zeno was fascinated by their world's unique features and loved sharing stories about Earth too - where they had different-colored birds called toucans with large, beautifully colored beaks; giant pandas that curled up like little balls in slumber or the vast oceans teeming with life.

One day while exploring a nearby forest edge near their home on F's surface (their planet was tidally locked to Trappist-1), Zeno found beautiful amethyst crystals and brought them back for his parents’ approval as they had learned about Earth rocks in stories told by the elders.

As he walked towards his family, a shimmering light caught his eye - it was from their sun which wasn't like any stars that filled skies of other worlds Zeno knew existed. It looked small and delicate but glowed brightly every day without fail due to its proximity being just 4 times the distance between Earth and Sun!

Zeno ran towards his parents excited by this discovery as he had learned from stories about how each planet’s size, temperature and potential habitability is determined based on where it lies in our own solar system. And now here was a sun so close that its planets could bask under such consistent warmth without fear of freezing like their distant cousin Earth did during winter months or getting scorched by the Sun's harshness as they knew happened to some parts back home on planet Mercury and Venus, who lived closer than F.

When Zeno reached his family he shared all that had transpired about this little sun of their own which seemed so unique among its kin - a testament in factual fiction where the Trappist-1 system held some special surprises for young explorers like him, making tales even more enchanting as they expanded knowledge beyond textbooks and imaginations.
