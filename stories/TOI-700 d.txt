Once upon a time, far, far away in space, there was a very special planet called TOI-700 d. This planet is amazing because it orbits in the "habitable zone" of its star, which means it might be just the right temperature for life, just like Earth!

A smart space telescope named TESS discovered TOI-700 d. The planet is about 100 light-years away from us, so it's super far, but TESS was able to find it by looking closely at a star called TOI-700. It’s a small, cool star, much dimmer than our Sun. TOI-700 d is the perfect distance from its star to not be too hot or too cold—just like Goldilocks' porridge!

TOI-700 d is a bit bigger than Earth, but no one knows what it looks like yet. Maybe it has oceans, mountains, or even clouds. Some scientists believe that if we could visit, we might find plants or even strange animals!

Even though it’s far away, the discovery of TOI-700 d gives us hope that there could be other planets just like Earth out there, waiting for us to explore.

So next time you look up at the stars, remember: there's a whole universe filled with incredible planets, and TOI-700 d is one of the most exciting of them all!
